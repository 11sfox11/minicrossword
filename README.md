This project will theoretically generate a miniature crossword (like you can find in the New York Times) given a grid with a couple words already in. Currently it's not 100% functional but it ain't doin too bad.

Word list: 500 most common words for each of 5 letter, 4 letter, and 3 letter words. This is pretty small. But it's fast! If it can actually finish!
